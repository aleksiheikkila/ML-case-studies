### RNN language model for Finnish

To be done with the following plan:
 - Collect large Finnish text corpora from various open sources (like old-ish literature from project Gutenberg, Finnish wikipedia dumps etc.)
 - Train a RNN-based architecture on that, maybe on character-level.
 - Use the trained model to generate Finnish text, given a context

This would likely need days of training to end up with something sensible :)
