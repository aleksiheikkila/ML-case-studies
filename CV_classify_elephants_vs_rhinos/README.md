### Classifying random selection of images of elephants and rhinos

For this small project, I harvested ~200 elephant or rhino images from google image search. I trained (or tuned) a (pretrained) CNN model to classify the images into these to categories using the fastai package (version 0.7)

This is based on fast.ai courses (from 2017/2018 or so). Fast.ai course notebook was the foundation on which I added my contributions.
