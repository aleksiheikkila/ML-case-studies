### Machine learning case studies

#### Repo structure

Each case study / experiment / project in separate folder. Case studies:

 - **Human activity recognition (HAR)**
 
    Using smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope time series data to classify what activity was being performed. LSTM-based solution with minimal feature engineering.

 - **Computer vision image classification to separate elephants from rhinos**
 - A toy example of **market basket analysis**
 - **RNN language model for Finnish** (to be completed)
